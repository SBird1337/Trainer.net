Trainer.net
===========
The open source trainer editor for generation three. Currently heavily in-dev, so I do not recommend to use the tool,
you might want to take a look at the code though if you want.

To use the code you'll need Single.net which can be found on my github account https://github.com/SBird1337/Single.net
or you can just reference it from the bin/release folder where a somehow new build of the library should be included.
